# PIAS (AngularJS + Sails.js)

### Why?
Modern web applications has separated front- and backend sides to use. This 'boilerplate' present one way to make
<em>your</em> application which have fully separated back- and frontend sides. And really this is more than just a
boilerplate, proper term would be 'example application'.

### Directory structure
* ```backend``` = Sails.js server, just API nothing else [repository](https://github.com/lohbrand/pias-2-backend)
* ```frontend``` = Angular SPA, just frontend side [repository](https://github.com/lohbrand/pias-2-frontend)

Also note that these 'directories' are just submodules to another repos
